BASICS
- you don't have to put a ';' at the end of a line/command
Variables
- you don't have to give datatype in front of a variable name
- you can just do ' name = value '
- but normally /better to use 'let' -> let num = 2 +4
- you cannot declare a variable a second time! 
- variable names can't have numbers at the first place
- you can use & and _ as the only special characters in variable names
Constants
- use const keyword for 'variables' that are constant

DATATYPES
01
- primitve dt's are: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol
- object dt's are all other things
- number can take up to e^308 big
- BigInt is a subtype of number
- floating point numbers are also of type number
- use underscore to make things readable : 10_004_000
- infinity is a subtype of number / even -infinity exists
- use 'n" after the number to mark it as BigInt
02:
- NaN means not a number
- NaN is of type number!?
03: Type Conversion-Type Coercion
- to convert from Number to String use String(234)
- to convert from String to Number use Number("234")
- for coercion see the file 03_typeConversion
- if you convert a Number into a Boolean you will get "true" as a value, only for 0,-0,null,0n,undefined and NaN you'll get "false"
07?: logical operators
- & is used for bitwise operators, && is used for comparison
______________________________________
12: conditionals: if/else
- it is good practice to put a ; at the end of a statement
- by default every condition has only one statement
- otherwise use curly brackets like in java
14: switch statement
- like in java you have to use break to get out of the statement; same as in java
15: template litera
