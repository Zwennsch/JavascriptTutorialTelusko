BASICS
- you don't have to put a ';' at the end of a line/command
Variables
- you don't have to give datatype in front of a variable name
- you can just do ' name = value '
- but normally /better to use 'let' -> let num = 2 +4
- you cannot declare a variable a second time! 
- variable names can't have numbers at the first place
- you can use & and _ as the only special characters in variable names
Constants
- use const keyword for 'variables' that are constant
