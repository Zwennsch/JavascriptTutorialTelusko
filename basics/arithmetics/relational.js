let x = "Sven"

console.log(x>y)

// it compares each character one by one, because each character has an ASCII value
let a = "2"
let b = 1

console.log(a >b)
//it works because a gets converted automatically into a number

let one = "1"
let two = 1

console.log(one == two)
console.log(one === two) //this compares the type equality
